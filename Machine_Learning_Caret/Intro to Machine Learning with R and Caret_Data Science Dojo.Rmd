Replace missing embardked values with mode
```{R}
table(train$Embarked)
train$Embarked[train$Embarked==""]<-"S"

Add a feature for tracking missing ages
```{r}
summary(train$Age)
train$missingAge<-ifelse(is.na(train$Age),"Y","N")
```
Add a feature for family size
```{r}
train$FamilySize<-1+train$SibSp+train$Parch
```

Set up factor

```{r}
train$Survived<-as.factor(train$Survived)
train$Pclass<-as.factor(train$Pclass)
train$Sex<-as.factor(train$Sex)
