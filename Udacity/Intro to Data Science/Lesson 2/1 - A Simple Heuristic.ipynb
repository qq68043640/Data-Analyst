A data scientist also creates mathematical models \n","    to make predictions based on some attributes from the data that they are examining.\n","\n","    We would like for you to take your knowledge and intuition about the Titanic\n","    and its passengers' attributes to predict whether or not the passengers survived\n","    or perished.

The\n","    key of the dictionary should be the passenger's id (which can be accessed\n","    via passenger[\"PassengerId\"]) and the associated value should be 1 if the\n","    passenger survied or 0 otherwise.\n","\n","    For example, if a passenger is predicted to have survived:\n","    passenger_id = passenger['PassengerId']\n","    predictions[passenger_id] = 1\n","\n","    And if a passenger is predicted to have perished in the disaster:\n","    passenger_id = passenger['PassengerId']\n","    predictions[passenger_id] = 0\n","    \n","    You can also look at the Titantic data that you will be working with\n","    at the link below:\n","    https://s3.amazonaws.com/content.udacity-data.com/courses/ud359/titanic_data.csv\n","    '''\n","\n","    predictions = {}\n","    df = pd.read_csv(file_path)\n","    for passenger_index, passenger in df.iterrows():\n","        passenger_id = passenger['PassengerId']\n","        if passenger[\"Sex\"]==\"female\":\n","            predictions[passenger_id]=\"Not survived\"\n","        else:\n","            passenger[\"survive\"]=\"Not survived\"\n","        \n","        # Your code here:\n","        # For example, let's assume that if the passenger\n","        # is a male, then the passenger survived.\n","        #     if passenger['Sex'] == 'male':\n","        #         predictions[passenger_id] = 1\n","        \n","    return predictions"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"name":"conda-root-py","display_name":"Python [conda root]","language":"python"},"language_info":{"mimetype":"text/x-python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","name":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython2","version":"2.7.12","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"version":2,"name":"ipython"}}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
